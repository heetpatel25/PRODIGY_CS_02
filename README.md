# 🔐 Image Encryption and Decryption Tool  
**Prodigy InfoTech – Cyber Security Internship (Task 02)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **Image Encryption and Decryption Tool** using Python.  
The goal is to demonstrate how **digital images can be secured** using encryption techniques at the **pixel level**, making the image unreadable to unauthorized users and restoring it back through decryption.

This task focuses on **multimedia security**, an important domain in modern cybersecurity.

## 🛡️ Features
- Encrypts images by transforming pixel values  
- Decrypts encrypted images back to the original form  
- Preserves image dimensions and format  
- Supports RGB image processing  
- Simple and efficient implementation  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User provides an input image  
2. Image pixels are extracted and converted into arrays  
3. Encryption is performed using **pixel-level manipulation**  
4. Encrypted image becomes visually unreadable  
5. Decryption reverses the encryption using the same logic/key  
6. Original image is restored successfully

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **NumPy** – for pixel-level operations  
- **Pillow (PIL)** – for image processing  
- **VS Code**  
- **Git & GitHub**
